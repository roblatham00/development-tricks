# Continuing Education

Learning never stops.  New programming languages, new tools, new techniques...
we're a long way from punch cards and hopefully continue to evolve to be even
more productive.

## Learning new languages

I have been programming in C for 25 years and it's still my reflex language.
However, I'm trying to learn more languages.  Once you've done "hello world"
and a few examples, it helps to have some non-trivial problems with precise
solutions you can tackle:

* Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/)
* Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/)


## Bookshelf

In a world of video tutorials and blog posts, I still like a good bound book:

### General

- _Autotools_ by John Calcote:  The GNU Autotools (autoocnf, automake, libtool)
  -- maybe you love them maybe you hate them but you'll like them a lot better
  after reading this book
- _Introduction to Algorithms_ by Cormen, Leierson, Rivest, and Stein: I had to
  look up the exact name of the authors because everyone just calls this "CLR".
- _Learning the Bash Shell_ by Cameron Newham:  you log into any machine and
  you'll be dropped into a shell.  Knowing what it can do, and how to set it up
  effectively, is a massive productivity boost.  This book obviously covers
  Bash, but whatever shell you like spend some time learning the ins and outs.
- _Pro Git_ by Chacon and Straub:  look, git is not without its messy corners
  and strange interfaces but it's something we've all got to know today.

### C

- _21st Century C_ by Ben Klemens: A good "next book" on C and development in
  C.  The book I wish I could have read 20 years ago.

### C++

- _C++ Primer (5th Edition)_ by Lippman, Lajoie, Moo: Covers everything in
  "modern" C++ (C++11).  C++ has seen several major additions since, but this
  book is still relevant.
- _Effective Modern C++_ by Scott Meyers:  not a language reference, but a
  guide on how to use C++.  I'm sad he's retired from book writing: the
  language has changed a little bit since these books written.
