# Assorted stuff I've picked up over the years

Does everyone already know this stuff?  Maybe you're one of the lucky 10,000?

Or maybe I get to be one of the lucky 10,000 if after seeing this you're all
"hey did you know about ..." when you send a pull request on this project.

Or maybe I can trigger Cunningham's Law:

> The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer

-- Ward Cunningham

I hope that me suggesting the way I do some of these things will trigger a
bunch of "well actually you should really try...".   That would be a great
outcome!

## Contributing

Absolutley I'd like to hear from my peers.   It would be great if after reading/seeing this you thought "I gotta tell someone about ___".  
Go ahead and open a pull request.  Start a github discussion.  Share with your friend.  I learned so much from other developers, and I hope
I can continue to learn for the rest of my career.
