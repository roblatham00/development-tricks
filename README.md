Or maybe I get to be one of the lucky 10,000 if after seeing this you're all
"hey did you know about ..." when you send a pull request on this project.

* fun stuff with [gdb](gdb/README.md)
* [performance profiling](profiling/README.md) with gdb
* [graphviz](graphviz/README.md) for programming
* [shell things](shell/README.md)
* [ltrace](ltrace/README.md)
* [learning never ends](learning/README.md)
* [work-life balance](work-life-balance/README.md)

I gave a presentation at work covering some of this: [MCS CS Seminar series](https://www.anl.gov/mcs/cs-seminar-series)

## Contributing

Absolutley I'd like to hear from my peers.   It would be great if after reading/seeing this you thought "I gotta tell someone about ___".  
Go ahead and open a pull request.  Start a github discussion.  Share with your friend.  I learned so much from other developers, and I hope
I can continue to learn for the rest of my career.
