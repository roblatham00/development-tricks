# Balance

I don't have any code fragment or fun graphic to share here.

When you go home, be home.  I don't think I ever solved a problem staying up
late to work on it, but I definitely remember the times I got answers while
washing the dishes, taking a shower, waking up after getting enough sleep.

I was not exactly athletic growing up.  Still am not!  Turns out when you are
old it doesn't matter.  There's a park district or pick up league out there
that's just happy to have another player.  I sound like my parents: go do
something besides staring at your code editor.
