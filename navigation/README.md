# Navigating large codebases

Both of these tools have very good integration with vim and emacs.

* [cscope](https://cscope.sourceforge.net/) Fantastic for C.  Pretty good for C++ (can get confused by overloaded functions)
* [ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) Supports tons of languages.  Like cscope, can take you to where this function is implemented.  Unlike cscope, less good at taking you to callers of this function.
